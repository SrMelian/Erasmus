## Description
*Single Page* app, made it responsive with Bootstrap. The app consults a JSON file (simulating a database) which contains the destinations of the Erasmus scholarship of the last years, with these data a consultation is made to the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to show the map and the marks with all the info.
Also you can add a location through the API, and save it in the JSON file.
